# About: #
Once users are registered, they can log in to the chat server site and create public or private chatrooms. Public chatrooms can be joined by any user and private chatrooms are password protected. Any user can send a private message to another user in the same chatroom. The creator of a chatroom has the ability to temporarily block or permanently ban another user from the chatroom.
