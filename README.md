1. We created a chat history feature. Every time a user joins a chatroom they can see all of the messages previously
sent to that room. Additionally, if a user leaves a chatroom and rejoins it, he/she will still be able to see the past
messages. 

2. We created two radio boxes to stylize the user's message. The "B" button makes the message bold and the "I" button
makes the message italics. The message will appear as bold or italics on the screen for all users in the chatroom.
